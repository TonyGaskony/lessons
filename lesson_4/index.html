          focuses on creating robots with advanced mobility, dexterity and
          intelligence. We have long held that mobility sufficient to access
          both the atural and the built world required legs. We began the
          pursuit of this dream over 30 years ago, first in academia and then as
          part of Boston Dynamics because it was an exciting technical challenge
          and because our goal of building a highly mobile robot required it. We
          wanted to build a robot that could go where people go. The commonly
          referred to “dull, dirty and dangerous” tasks don’t occur solely on a
          neatly organized factory floor, they pop up in the natural world and
          human-built environments. These are places where being effective
          requires deftly maneuvering through rocky trails, staircases,
          catwalks, doors or narrow cluttered passages. While we take the
          natural world as inspiration for our robots, the design is ultimately
          motivated by functionality. Our robots end up moving like humans and
          animals not because we designed them to look like humans and animals
          but because we made them balance. Balance and dynamic motion are
          characteristics we have previously only seen in animals. It is this
          organic quality of dynamically stable motion that people tend to
          associate with lifelike movement. Partly because of the benefits of
          dynamic motion, our robots can navigate tough unstructured, unknown or
          antagonistic terrain with ease. Wheeled and tracked robots are limited
          by stairs, gaps, ground-level obstructions such as cabling and staged
          materials and minor height differences in flooring. These environments
          don't present the same challenges for legged robots.

        <h2>WHAT MAKES BOSTON DYNAMICS UNIQUE?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          One of the things that makes Boston Dynamics unique is the ambition to
          build dynamically stable, legged machines. Marc Raibert began tackling
          this problem before anyone else in the world. And we’ve been at it
          since, almost 35 years. We’ve been inspired by and worked towards this
          goal for so long that we have invented techniques to make robots work
          that you can’t find in any textbook or technical article. The result
          is that we now know how to build walking machines of any size, shape,
          actuator style or powerplant. These unique designs enable our robots
          to conquer terrains inaccessible to others, and perform automated
          tasks in unstructured environments.

        <p>
          Spot is available for commercial purchase by contacting our sales
          team. You can also contact our sales team about Stretch, our mobile
          robot for case handling in the warehouse, scheduled to be available
          for commercial purchase in 2022.

        <p>
          We take great care to make sure our customers intend to use our robots
          legally. We cross-check every purchase request against the U.S.
          Government's denied persons and entities lists, prior to authorizing a
          sale. In addition, all buyers must agree to our Terms and Conditions
          of Sale, which state that our products must be used in compliance with
          the law, and cannot be used to harm or intimidate people or animals,
          or be used as a weapon or configured to hold a weapon. Any violation
          of our Terms will automatically void the product’s warranty and
          prevent the robot from being updated, serviced, repaired or replaced.

          Our mission is to imagine and create exceptional robots that enrich
          people’s lives. By building robots that have the mobility, dexterity
          and perception required to contribute to our modern society we strive
          to create a future in which humans and machines work together to
          improve everyone's safety, productivity and quality of life. Read more

        <h2>HOW IS SPOT BEING USED BY POLICE DEPARTMENTS?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Police and fire departments are using Spot to get remote visibility
          into potentially dangerous situations. By remotely assessing a scene
          before taking action, police can make more informed decisions that
          reduce risk, improve safety, and de-escalate conflict. Police
          departments use Spot to inspect suspicious packages and environments
          for hazardous materials or explosives, assess hostile threats
          remotely, and to search structurally dangerous environments in
          emergency response scenarios. We believe that our robots can be used
          to keep first responders and the public safe. Learn more about the
